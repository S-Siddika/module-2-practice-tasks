        <h3>Earth</h3>
        <p>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Milkyway Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.</p>
